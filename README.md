# Weather Notification Script

## Why Did I Make This?
I often check the weather forecast in Canberra to figure out when I should do my laundry since I don’t have a dryer. I also check it to decide how warmly I should dress.  
With the weather being so inconsistent this year, I found myself either constantly checking the forecast or suffering through the cold or heat.  
I made this script so I don’t have to manually look up the forecast. I know I could just use Google Assistant, but I have my voice assistant deactivated because I’m paranoid.  
The inspiration for this project came from Day 35 of the [**100 Days of Python Coding**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Coursera.

## What Does It Do?
This Python script sends me notifications via Twilio SMS. It checks the weather forecast using [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and provides:
- **Laundry Day Suggestions:** Tells me when it will rain in the next 5 days so I can plan my laundry.
- **Outfit Recommendations for the Day:** Based on temperature, wind, and rain conditions.

The current code is set to send me notifications for laundry suggestions on Monday and Thursday, and outfit recommendations on weekdays.

## How Does It Work?
The free tier of [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) is sufficient for this project. I am also using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/login)'s free credit, which will be enough to run this project for a while.  
I am currently hosting and running this project on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/login/). You can also host and automate running it on GitHub using GitHub Actions!

The text with the blue border is the final text. The shady number you see is the one generated by Twilio.

## Learning
**Realistic Scope:** It's easy to get carried away with endless improvements in a project. Setting a clear, realistic scope and sticking to it ensures the project is manageable. </br>
**The Potential of APIs:** I was amazed by how many free APIs are available for various purposes. This experience has opened my eyes to the vast possibilities, and I’m excited to build more projects that can make my daily life easier.</br>
**Choosing the Right Tool:** Clearly defining your needs is crucial. Once you have a solid understanding, being able to compare and select the right tool for the job is key to building efficient and effective solutions.</br>
